                    <h2>How to design a multiplayer game?</h2> 
                    <p>
                        Designing a multiplayer game from the start can be a daunting task. 
                        Terminology, such as "server-side" and "client-side" maybe a stressful topic to learn about.
                        However, I will show you that multiplayer game programming is not a difficult task.
                    </p>

                        For your first multiplayer project, it is important to keep it simple. 
                        Don't try to make the next MMORPG. It simply won't happen. For your first project,
                        start by making a couch coop that can be played on 1 computer. After that has been finished, take
                        that same project and develop it to be online multiplayer. This next step is a big step, but an important
                        one. As for the system of multiplayer, start with a peer-to-peer game. This won't be too complicated as you
                        won't have to worry about server authentication and validating user inputs.
